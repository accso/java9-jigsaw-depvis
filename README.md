# DepVis (Java 9 Jigsaw Dependency Visualizer)

### Info

### What is this about?
DepVis visualizes dependencies of Java 9 Jigsaw modules as defined in 
[Project Jigsaw](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/) by [JSR 376]
(https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=376) and [JEP 261](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/261). 
DepVis produces a [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org) output file (DOT file) which can be rendered with GraphViz in a separate step.

Result looks like this (in this case all Java 9 system modules (build 181) are visualized with all relationships, limited to modules with prefix "java.*"):
![Java 9 System Modules](Sample-J9SystemModules.png)

#### DepVis takes into account:
1. Requires/Read relationships (currently visualized as a blue arrow)
   * requires mandated to `java.base` (dashed blue arrow)
   * requires transitive (blue arrow)
   * requires static (dotted blue arrow)
2. Requires transitive transitivity (green arrow)
   * If `moda--requires-transitive-->modb` (blue) and `modc--requires-->moda` (blue), then also `modc--requires-->modb` (green). Note that this is currently limited to 1-transitivity.
2. Exports-To relationships (red)
3. Opens-To relationships (orange)

#### Further hints:
1. DepVis can be configured, see section below.
2. A legend is written in the top left corner. As this unfortunately flips the whole graph, this is done as a separate graph.
3. A helper printer tool is also included which prints the relationship to STDOUT.

### Setup
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install a Java 9 JDK with Jigsaw support. DepVis has been tested with Java9 build 181 and also with 9.0.1-11 (both on Windows 10, x64) 
3. Install GraphViz 2.38.
4. If running on Windows, install a bash, like for example [Babun](https://babun.github.io/)
5. Edit file `env.sh` to configure `JAVA_HOME` and `GRAPHVIZ_HOME` (see TODO markers)
6. Also edit file `env.sh` to configure the path separator. If run on Windows, use \; (a blackslash quoting a ;). If you run all stuff on *nix, use a colon : .
7. Call `clean.sh`, `compile.sh` and `run-vis.sh` (or `all.sh` for all in one step).
8. Output is `moduledependencies.dot` and `moduledependencies.png` (and a second file pair `...with-legend`).

### Configuration
DepVis can be configured in a configuration properties file (see depvis.properties) as follows:

1. `depvis.includeFilter`
   * comma-separated Strings
   * module names whitelist, _all_ used to be checked with `String.startsWith`
   * if not set, all modules from system and/or module-path will be used
   * example: `java.,jdk.`
2. `depvis.excludeFilter`   
   * comma-separated Strings
   * module names blacklist, _all_ used to be checked with `String.startsWith`
   * if not set, all modules from system and/or module-path will be used
   * example: `jdk.internal`
3. `depvis.useSystemModules`
   * boolean, default is true
   * do we want to visualize modules from system (i.e. `java.*`, `jdk.*` etc.)?
4. `depvis.useModulePath`
    * boolean, default is true
    * want to visualize modules from a module path
    * if so, `depvis.modulePath` needs to be set
5. `depvis.modulePath`
    * path Strings, separated by system's file separator) 
    * set a local module path
    * example: `/jigsaw/example/mlib`
6. `depvis.showRequires`
    * boolean, default is true
    * want to visualize requires/reads relationships?
7. `depvis.showRequiresMandated`
   * boolean, default is true
   * want to visualize requires/reads mandated relationships?
8. `depvis.showRequiresStatic`
   * boolean, default is true
   * want to visualize requires/reads static relationships?
9. `depvis.showRequiresTransitive`
   * boolean, default is true
   * want to visualize requires/reads transitive relationships (1-transitive)?
10. `depvis.showExports`, only needed for the Printer
    * boolean, default is true
    * want to print exports?
11. `depvis.showExportsTo`
    * boolean, default is true
    * want to visualize exports-to relationships?
12. `depvis.showOpens`, only needed for the Printer
    * boolean, default is true
    * want to print opens?
13. `depvis.showOpensTo`
    * boolean, default is true
    * want to visualize opens-to relationships?
14. `depvis.showUses`
    * boolean, default is true
    * want to print uses?
15. `depvis.showProvided`
    * boolean, default is true
    * want to print provides?
16. `depvis.showContains`, only needed for the Printer
    * boolean, default is true
    * want to print contains, i.e. all concealed packages?
17. `depvis.showMainClass`
    * boolean, default is true
    * want to print the main class?
16. `depvis.prefixWithModuleName`, only needed for the Printer
    * boolean, default is true
    * want to prefix each output line with the module name & version (for easier grep's)?
17. `depvis.outputFileName`, only needed for the Visualizer
    * String
    * filename for the DOT output file
    * example: `/tmp/moduledependencies.dot`
18. `depvis.showLegend`, only needed for the Visualizer
    * boolean, default is true
    * want to visualize a legend plus title and timestamp?
    * if so, the graph will be flipped to LR
19. `depvis.diagramTitle`, only needed for the Visualizer
    * String
    * configure a title for the diagram

### TODOs, LOP, Backlog, Ideas, ...
No software is ready, ever ;-) So here are some ideas left (any other feedback very welcome!):

- [ ] Show requires transitive dependencies with a different line style
- [ ] Include n-transitivity for requires-transitive (currently limited to 1-transitivity)
- [ ] Allow filtering of individual relationships (black/white listing)
- [ ] Include a module's hash value
- [ ] Currently, DepVis only shows modules from the Observable Modules (= module path and system modules). Alternatively allow to show modules from a Configuration.
- [ ] Allow to configure colors, edge styles, node styles/shapes etc. via config file from outside (currently one needs to change Java class depvis.GraphVizHelper.java and recompile).
- [ ] Adding a GraphViz legend seems only possible with `rankdir=LR`. This settings then flips the whole graph (as it cannot be done in a subgraph only). Any way to get around this?
- [ ] Write the package name(s) to an exports-to edge
- [ ] Layouting: Any text added as label to an edge should be visualized "closely"

### Latest changes

#### Migration to Java 9.0.1 (Release)
No changes necessary

#### Latest features, all new in 0.3 
- Include all requires static (both in printer and visualizer - visualized as in dotted blue arrows, also done in the legend)
- Include all opens (only in the printer, not in the visualizer)
- Include all opens-to (both in printer and visualizer - visualized as in orange arrows, also done in the legend)
- Prints all uses and all provides (only in the printer, not in the visualizer)
- Prints the contains, i.e. concealed packages (only in the printer, not in the visualizer)
- Prints the main class (only in the printer, not in the visualizer)
- Print output can now prefix each output line with the module name, see option `depvis.prefixWithModuleName`
- Open Modules are now visualized as octagons
- Migrated to Java 9 final release (181), migrated to Eclipse 4.7.1a
